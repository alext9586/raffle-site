# Surely: The Raffle App

This is a simple web app that simulates issuing and drawing tickets at a raffle. It is written in Typescript and AngularJS as a single page application. It is purely a client-side app with no back-end interactions. It saves the data to the browser's local storage.

Despite this project being so simple, it is very personal to me. My organization throws a public holiday party where people participate in a [white elephant gift exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_elephant_gift_exchange), and I wanted to make an app that drew random numbers out of a hat. I worked on this app while I was visiting my sick mother. This app is dedicated to my mother even though she had no idea I was writing it nor was she able to see it in its finished state.

If you got some use out of the app or the code and would like to donate, please donate to the [National Breast Cancer Foundation](http://www.nationalbreastcancer.org/) or the [Breast Cancer Research Foundation](https://www.bcrfcure.org/) instead.
